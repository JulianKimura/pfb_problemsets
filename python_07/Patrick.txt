Patrick by Shel Silverstein

Patrick loves me,
Patrick cares,
Patrick picks me peaches and pears.
Patrick offers me candy and Cokes,
Patrick listens and laughs at me jokes.
Patrick helps when I get in a fight,
Patrick does all my homework at night.
Patrick misses me,
Patrick cries,
Patrick thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Patrick is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Patrick just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Patrick's hand,
In the darkness where Patrick usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Patrick's gone!
